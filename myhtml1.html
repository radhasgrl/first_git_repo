        <q>Lorem Ipsum</q> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
        ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
        only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
        passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        Albert Einstein once said <blockquote>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.
        One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of the eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of 
        reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.</blockquote>
